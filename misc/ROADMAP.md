- Create new group based on a filter
- Provide a searchacble name by block
- rewrite readme

# Replace weird selection logi for blocks with a `where` clause

# Computing metadata

I'm not super happy with the way metadata works. I should probably think about that harder

- Make a web based interface so you can inespect the output more easily
- Figure out how to speed up the startup time. The ease of installation of `-onefile` is nice in pyinstaller, but 6 seconds is a long time to wait. Maybe I could make a REPL for more interactive use?
