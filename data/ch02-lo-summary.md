Upon completion of this chapter, learners will be able to:

- Understand and apply foundational concepts of microservices, including information hiding,
  coupling, and cohesion, and how these influence the design and boundaries of microservices.
- Comprehend the role of domain-driven design in modeling microservices and its core concepts such
  as ubiquitous language, aggregate, and bounded context.
- Identify and mitigate potential issues related to different types of coupling in microservices,
  including domain, temporal, pass-through, common, and content coupling.
- Understand and apply alternative techniques to Domain-Driven Design for establishing microservice
  boundaries, including volatility-based decomposition and technology-based decomposition.
