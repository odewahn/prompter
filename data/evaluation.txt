# NEW QUESTION

Quality of the question: The questions are of good quality. They are clear, concise, and directly related to the topic of microservices 
modeling. They test the understanding of key concepts and techniques related to the design and boundaries of microservices.

Quality of the options: The options are well-crafted. They include both correct and plausible incorrect choices, which makes the questions

# NEW QUESTION

<h1>Formative</h1>

<p>Domain-Driven Design for Microservices</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>What is the role of bounded contexts in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for microservices?</p>

<ul> <li>[ ] Bounded contexts are used to define the physical boundaries of a microservice.</li> <li>[X] Bounded contexts are used to hide 
internal complexity and present a clear boundary to the wider  system.</li> <li>[ ] Bounded contexts are used to define the communication 
protocols between microservices.</li> <li>[ ] Bounded contexts are used to define the data storage mechanisms for a microservice.</li> 
</ul>
