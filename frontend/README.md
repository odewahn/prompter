# React + Vite

# Pre-requisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Node and then install [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). You'll also have to run `npm install` the first time you clone this repo.

# Development

Start prompter in another terminal tab:

```
reloadium run main.py
```

Start the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Go to the URL the dev server tells you to go to.

# Production

Build the app

```
npm run build
```

The outputs will be written to the `../src/static` directory, which will be bundled with the binary when you build prompter.
